## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A gradient from #9400D3 (dark violet) to #4B0082 (indigo), inspired by the logo, to give a modern and artistic feel.
- Background color: Black (#000000) for a modern and sophisticated backdrop that makes the accent colors pop.
- Accent color: Use a lighter shade of violet, such as #BA55D3 (medium orchid), to highlight key elements like buttons and interactive components. This color is derived from the logo's gradient.
- Font: 'Montserrat', a versatile sans-serif font suitable for both headlines and body text, providing a clean and modern look.
- Use a vertical timeline structure for events, with alternating cards on either side of a central line.
- Apply smooth scrolling and subtle animations, like fade-in and slide-in, for event card visibility. Ensure animations are performant and enhance user experience.
- Create an intro animation with fading and scaling effects for the logo and tagline. This should set a professional and engaging tone right from the start.
